  data-restaurant="YOUR_RESTAURANT_ID" 
  defer
></script>
```

## Test It Out

2. **Click the button** - opens the full menu interface
3. **Try the chat** - ask "Italian dishes?" or "What's popular?"

**P.S.** The widget is designed to be lightweight and won't slow down your website. It loads asynchronously and only appears when customers click the button.
